# Late Night Install

## A Programmer's Nocturne

In the quiet of the midnight hour,  
When the world has gone to rest,  
Lines of code like stars do flower,  
As I put MCPs to test.

Repositories born in darkness,  
APIs connecting true,  
Errors fought with steadfast hardness,  
Green lights shining through.

Frameworks dancing in the shadows,  
Dependencies align,  
Each command a step that follows,  
On this journey so divine.

The cursor blinks, a steady beacon,  
Through the night's long, silent span,  
Each function call that I am seeking,  
Works according to my plan.

And when the morning light comes creeping,  
Through the window to my eyes,  
The code I wrote while others sleeping,  
Stands as my hard-won prize.
